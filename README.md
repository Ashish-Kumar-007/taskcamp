## 🧩 Problem Statement

### ❌ Why most to-do apps fail:

* They **only store tasks** — they don’t help you **think**.
* People often struggle with **task overwhelm** and **decision fatigue**.
* No built-in **planning assistant** to help organize tasks based on urgency and deadlines.

| No sense of priority    | 🎯 AI assigns urgency and deadlines                                                        |
| Hard to plan daily work | 📅 AI creates a schedule based on your task list                                           |
| Manual task entry       | 💬 You can describe what you want to do in plain English, and TaskCamp will generate tasks |
